# Leveraging-Earth-Observation-Data-for-Informed-Agricultural-Decision-Making

We developed AgriSphere - a web platform dedicated to facilitating crucial NASA geospatial data for agricultural workers. Incorporating GeoViews, MatPlotLib, HoloViews, and X-Array, we enabled the accessible visualization of .nc4 and .csv information files. Building on this goal of accessibility, we used OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo Model and trained it on NASA datasets as well as our own website's architecture. To ensure the provision of accurate information, we accessed our NASA API key and built our Web Scraper to update our visualizations in accordance with the frequency of provision of NASA geospatial data.
